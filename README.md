## About JAM

The **Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM)** is a novel blockchain architecture developed by Polkadot that enables developers to create custom services with their own state transitions and execution logic. JAM provides a more flexible and efficient approach to building decentralized applications compared to traditional smart contract platforms.

**Key features:**
- **Flexible Service Model** - Define custom services with their own logic and state
- **High Performance** - Optimized for throughput and scalability
- **Interoperability** - Built-in support for cross-service communication
- **Developer-Friendly** - Rich tooling and development environment
